        <h2>Battles</h2>
        <p>A major part of Lineage II gameplay is the combat. Monsters can be found outside of Towns on the hunting fields or deep inside underground dungeons. When the player defeats a monster, their character gets XP and SP to help them level up and learn new skills. Players can also fight other players through a PvP system. </p>

        <h2>Create Your Hero</h2>
        <p>Shape your journey in Lineage II by creating a unique character from a selection of 7 unique races (Human, Elf, Dark Elf, Orc, Dwarf, Kamael, and Ertheia), each with their own unique characteristics and traits that lead you down the path of more than 30 potential classes you can evolve into. Whether you take the path of a Warrior to become a Dreadnought or grow from a Wizard to an Archmage, the choice is yours to make! In the world of Lineage II, whether you live or die depends on your skill in battle. Go face to face against foes of equal skill and experience or team up to challenge and overcome world boss raids where hundreds of able-bodied heroes may be needed! The thirst of combat is to be quenched with your blade! You can also create your own clan or join an existing clan of fellow adventurers to unite your power to defeat epic world bosses or other adversarial clans who stand in your way! Level up your clan and expand your membership as you continue to complete clan quests and achieve exclusive clan rewards and benefits!</p>
